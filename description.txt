Build a React application and optimize it using a multi-stage Docker build (Node for build stage + Nginx for production).

Create a Dockerfile and .dockerignore to reduce image size by excluding dev files and unnecessary folders.

Build the Docker image locally, run the container, and ensure the app is served on http://localhost.

Verify that the final image is lightweight & production-ready.

Set up CI/CD using GitHub Actions to automate build, test, and deployment steps.

Create .github/workflows/main.yml that triggers on push to main branch.

Automatically install Node dependencies, run tests (npm test), and build the project (npm run build).

Optionally deploy build files to hosting like GitHub Pages / Netlify / AWS S3.

Build a full-stack app (React frontend + Node/Express backend + optional DB like MongoDB).

Deploy frontend and backend to AWS EC2 instances.

Configure Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute traffic across backend servers.

Set up VPC, security groups, and domain routing (Route 53 optional).

Test the deployed app in browser to ensure high availability, scaling, & load balancing.
